Port of Unix TMG to C99. Work in progress.

About TMG
--
TMG is an early compiler-compiler, or, according to McIlroy:
> TMG is a string processing language especially intended for writing 
> translators for computer languages. It deals with string scanning, building
> of tables and output generation, and provides some integer arithmetic.

Initially created by Robert McClure (1965) to work on supercomputers and
mainframes of the time, TMG was cross-compiled for PDP-7 microcomputer by
Douglas McIlroy to work under Unix operating system. Soon after that the
language was further developed by McIlroy for Unix on PDP-11, creating a
unique and powerful dialect of McClure's TMG. This version of TMG was
included into Unix from Version 2 to Version 6, after which it was phased
out in favor of Stephen Johnson's YACC.

To the best of our knowledge, unlike other Unix tools, it was never implemented
in a high-level language. This is an attempt to translate TMG from PDP-11
assembly to portable C.
