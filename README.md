Port of Unix TMG to C99. Work in progress.

About TMG
--
TMG is an early compiler-compiler, or, according to McIlroy:
> TMG is a string processing language especially intended for writing 
> translators for computer languages. It deals with string scanning, building
> of tables and output generation, and provides some integer arithmetic.

Initially created by Robert McClure (1965) to work on supercomputers and
mainframes of the time, TMG was cross-compiled for PDP-7 microcomputer by
Douglas McIlroy to work under Unix operating system. Soon after that the
language was further developed by McIlroy for Unix on PDP-11, creating a
unique and powerful dialect of McClure's TMG. This version of TMG was
included into Unix from Version 2 to Version 6, after which it was phased
out in favor of Stephen Johnson's YACC.

To the best of our knowledge, unlike other Unix tools, it was never implemented
in a high-level language. This is an attempt to translate TMG from PDP-11
assembly to portable C.

Quotes about TMG
--
TMG was an early inspiration for Donald Knuth and his TAOCP. According to him:
> I was impressed by the metacompiler of Val Schorre and by the more powerful (though
> less elegant) "transmogrifier" of Bob McClure. I told Peter [Wegner] about my draft manuscript for
> Chapter 12 of The Art of Computer Programming, which included an example system of a similar kind,
> called TROL ("Translation-Oriented Language").

Stephen C. Johnson, creator of YACC, about his experience of working with TMG:
> There was a compiler/compiler in use at the Labs, imported I think by Doug
> McIlroy, called TMG.  It was a backtracking recursive descent compiler
> that could compile almost anything but was unbearably slow and, if it
> encountered a syntax error would backtrack back to the first character of
> the input file and say, in effect, "something's wrong in here somewhere".

Doug McIlroy, creator of the Unix dialect of TMG:
> And in some ways, TMG was nicer than YACC. Not specification of grammar, but it actually
> helps you do the translation. YACC only helps you do the parsing, it's up to you to do the
> translation after that.

Tom Duff, Bell Labs employee:
> It made syntax-directed translation really easy, but with an abstruse
> syntax and semantics that any esoteric language enthusiast could appreciate.
