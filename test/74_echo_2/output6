Initially created by Robert McClure (1965) to work on supercomputers and mainframes of the time, TMG was cross-compiled for PDP-7 microcomputer by Douglas McIlroy to work under Unix operating system. Soon after that the language was further developed by McIlroy for Unix on PDP-11, creating a unique and powerful dialect of McClure's TMG. This version of TMG was included into Unix from Version 2 to Version 6, after which it was phased out in favor of Stephen Johnson's YACC.
